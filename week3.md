#CSE15L Week 3 Lab Report
##Part 1


##Part 2

##Part 3
In the second Lab Session, I re-hosted a local server on my laptop. This was not the first time I did this,
as I have previously hosted a website that I built on my laptop. However, it was the first time I connected using an SSH
key to a server hosted by one of the computers in UCSD(201/202/203) and host my server there. I have never had an issue before with
hosting a server due to overcrowding(people using the same port on the local server), so this was a learning experience as I had to change the port
number. Also, it was fun to experiment with the code running on my friend's laptop on my own laptop just by changing the port number.
