## Installing VS Code
The first step in order to get started with the Lab Activity is to download VSCode. 
Windows and Mac users can download VSCode by clicking [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Depending on your Operating System, you can choose different links to download VSCode. Once you have downloaded VSCode, you can proceed to the next steps of the activity.

## Remotely Connecting
Again, depending on your operating system, there are different ways of remotely connecting to the server. In case you are a Windows user, you will need to download `git` first. You can download Git by going to [this](https://gitforwindows.org) link. 
Mac users do not need to install Git and can proceed directly to the next step.
Now, you need to go to [this](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) website and check the account details linked to your UCSD PID. Once you have done so, you will find your unique username beginning with `cs15lwi23`. Since you would most probably be logging into this website for the first time, it is highly recommended to change your password on the same link above. It might take upto 15 minutes for the new password changes to reflect.

Once the above step has been completed, you can open the terminal in VSCode and enter the following command:
`$ ssh cs15lwi23abc` where `abc` is your unique ID.
After successfully copying this, you will get the following message:

Respond, **yes** to this message on the terminal.
If completed successfully, the following dialogue should appear:

`Hello cs15lwi23amy, you are currently logged into ieng6-203.ucsd.edu

This message implies that you have finished the 'Remotely Connecting' part of the task.
